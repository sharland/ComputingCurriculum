# Bartholomew Networking department

## Network upgrades

* Operating system
* Software suite
  - Adobe CS6 Master Collection installed
  - lynda.com 
* VLE
- My Big Campus
* Transition from Council supplied email services
  - currently with Office365 hosted by county
  - going to have a transition point end of july when Bartholomew taking control with new empty accounts
  - staff will have to go through a lengthy transition process to get their email across to the new office365
  - but if I introduce Google apps this will mean another transition and another email address
  - keep everything to a single sign-on
  - many staff would be worried about email access at home and being chased by parents
  - email Jase about whether with a virtualised solution we could simply provide that access to the shared area online for home based access
