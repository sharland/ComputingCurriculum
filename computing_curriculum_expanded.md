# Computing Curriculum Expanded

An expansion of the meanings and terms related to the DfE computing curriculum.

## KS3

Pupils should be taught to:
1. design, use and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems
  * A computational abstraction is a process of separating ideas from how they actually function.  This allows us to deal with very complex systems in a simple way.  For example the London tube map shows a complex system using a simplified map which isn't actually representative of how the trains run underground.  It is an abstraction which models a physical system.
  * A model is a representation of a real-world system and is often a simplification of that system.  Pupils should be able to work with models and understand how they function and their purpose.
2. understand several key algorithms that reflect computational thinking [for example, ones for sorting and searching]; use logical reasoning to compare the utility of alternative algorithms for the same problem
  * An algorithm is a set of instructions for completing a task.
  * Computational thinking is the ability to solve a problem using computer science methods.
  * Therefore pupils should be able to understand not only what an algorithm does but also how algorithms which perform key tasks, such as the aforementioned sort and search, reflect a computational approach to solving a problem.
3. use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions
  * The obvious non-textual programming language is Scratch however there are other options like [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu) which is a continuation of Scratch and allows for more in-depth instructions.
  * A very popular textual language is Python as there are a number of resources available.  I teach using Python 3.
  * Data structures are a particular way of organising and structuring data in a system.  The simplest data structure probably familiar to most ICT teachers is a record in a database or spreadsheet table.
  * A list is [a sequential data structure](http://www.slideshare.net/derlaz/list-data-structure-presentation) and allows for additions and removals at any point on the list.
  * A list can also be seen as a way of storing many different values under a single variable. Every item on the list is numbered with an index value.
  * A table is an organised set of values using a structure of vertical columns and rows where the intersection between a column and row creates a cell for storing a single piece of data
  * A simple array is a linear array, also known as a one-dimensional array, which is a collection of data elements(values or variables) identified by at least one array index or key
  * A modular program is one where the functionality is split into independent, interchangeable modules.  Scratch is a great example of a modular programming language.
  * Python uses modules extensively and pupils could start by importing them to work with them or create their own modules using functions 
4. understand simple Boolean logic [for example, AND, OR and NOT] and some of its uses in circuits and programming; understand how numbers can be represented in binary, and be able to carry out simple operations on binary numbers [for example, binary addition, and conversion between binary and decimal]
  * Digital logic is the application of Boolean Algebra true and false statements using 1 or 0.
  * Further research needed on its use within circuitry although Minecraft Redstone provides some opportunities.
  * Looking at how decimal numbers are represented in binary has some cross-over with maths.  I would include both binary addition and subtraction.
5. understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems
  * For this pupils should be able to open up a computer at the very least and identify parts involved.  If possible get them to put a computer together although doing so on a computer which is already dead might be a good starting point!
  * With regard to communicating with one another this obviously refers to networking systems and therefore being able to setup a small network, preferably using Raspberry Pi computers would be advantageous.
6. understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system; understand how data of various types (including text, sounds and pictures) can be represented and manipulated digitally, in the form of binary digits
  * This also refers to algorithms and therefore links to point 2 above.  However this goes beyond two by looking at how a computer CPU handles instructions in storage by transferring them to working memory before executing them.  The best place to start with this would be breaking down the fetch-execute cycle.
  * Image, text and sound representation in binary is necessary for understanding how an image is stored on a computer.
7. undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals, including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users
  * This point essentially covers the creative use of ICT and computing tools to achieve an end-goal.
  * My approach to this will be to use simple website design using a Bootstrap template.  This will enable pupils to use multiple applications to create and edit the content for the website.
  * For the bit on collecting and analysing data I will be getting pupils to run a simple survey using Google Forms and then analysing the data produced in a spreadsheet.
8. create, re-use, revise and re-purpose digital artefacts for a given audience, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability
  * I see this as an extension to point seven.  Pupils should be able to use multiple tools in order to create a coherent and consistent product.
9. understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely, including protecting their online identity and privacy; recognise inappropriate content, contact and conduct and know how to report concerns.
  * This very simply is the esafety module.  This can be dealt with through many other modules when looking at how data is used and how attribution is given.
