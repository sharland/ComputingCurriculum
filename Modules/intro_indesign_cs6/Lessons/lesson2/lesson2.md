### Creating frames

The first step to layout your document is to start using frames to decide where your content is going to go.  inDesign has a couple of types:

1.  Text frame tool for adding new text to an area
	*  A useful technique here is using Type > Fill with placeholder text to drop 
2.  Rectangular frame tool for adding new content in shapes - this will be used for adding images later on in this lesson
3.  You can also use the pen or pencil tool to draw a shape and ten have this used as a frame

### Working with text flow

When developing complex layouts you may want to have one piece of text 'flow' between multiple text frames spread across a page.

Now is also a good chance to note that you can also import text documents in multiple formats into inDesign.  Once you have chosen the right import options click where you want the text to go and a text frame will be created for you.  If you have a lot of text and you want it to 'flow' across multiple pages then hold down the shift key before you place the text.

If you have a text frame already created and you have written too much information into it a red plus sign will appear next to the box.  Click this and you will be able to create a new text frame (warning: it might fill the page but is resizable) to the page.  Hold down the shift key to make it flow from the original text box.

### Modifying text and paragraph styles

Once you have inserted some text into a frame you can work with its style and some layout options using some of the windows available.  To see all the windows for working with type and paragraph go to Window in the menu bar and select one of the windows from Type and Tables.

### Inserting tables

You can insert tables quite easily in inDesign.  Create a text frame and use Table > Insert.  Select the right options for your table and insert.  Use the Table window to further tweak your settings.

### Working with images

inDesign does support copying and pasting images into a document.  However pasting an image embeds it and removes the original link to the file.  Placing may seem a bit more convoluted but it is far more powerful in the long run.

To add in content from outside inDesign use File > Place in a document.  Check the 'Show Import Options' box before importing if you want extra options.

If you have not already selected a frame you will need to drop the image into a frame.  You will probably notice that the image is significantly bigger than the frame.  If this is the case right click the frame or image and select 'Fitting' and choose an option to suit what you need.

If you do not have a frame draw one using the rectangular frame tool and then drag and drop the image onto the frame.

A good technique to become familiar with is selecting the frame border (which will be pale blue) and learning how to resize it and rotate it.  To resize it and keep the same dimensions hold down shift.  You can also rotate a frame from the corners.  You will probably need to use fitting again once you have changed the frame size in order to get the content to fit the frame or vice versa.
