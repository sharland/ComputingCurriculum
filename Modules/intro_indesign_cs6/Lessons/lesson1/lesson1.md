## Lesson description

### To create a new document

1.  Go to File > New Document
2.  Select whether you are designing a Print, Web or Digital Publishing document
3.  Choose the number of pages
4.  If you want to have your pages spread out like a book or magazine tick the 'Facing Pages' check-box.
5.  Choose a page size for the document
6.  Choose the number of columns for the page as well as a gutter value for the spacing between columns
7.  Choose values for the page margins

Click OK

If you go to the document setup you will be able to change some of these settings including number of pages and orientation.

### Workspace layout

*  Page: this is the main area of the program and workspace.  
*  Master pages: a template or master defining the look of your document
*  Spread: Two or more pages side by side
*  Pasteboard: Area around the edge of the page for storing objects until you are ready to use them

### Grids and Guides

Grids and guides are used to line up objects on a page and consistently across multiple pages.  Options for grids and guides are contained within the Layout menu.

There are two types of grids, Document and Baseline.

*  Document grid: used for aligning elements on a page 
*  Baseline grid: used for aligning text across columns

Both can be found in View > Grids and Guides.

Guides are more fluid and can be placed anywhere on a page.  You can add a guide by clicking on a ruler and dragging towards the page as well as using Layout > Create Guides.

You can clear all current guides and control whether objects snap to them using the View > Grids and Guides menu.

Once you insert an object and have it snapped to a guide you can lock that object to prevent it being accidentally shifted.  Once you have selected an object click on OBject > Lock.
