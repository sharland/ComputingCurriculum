## Lesson description

In this lesson we are going to look at some of the techniques for managing pages within inDesign.

### Inserting new pages and changing their settings

To add new pages to your document use Layout > Pages > Add or Insert Pages.  Insert pages gives you more options for controlling how the new page is added.

In File > Document setup you can also control various settings such as page orientation and size.

Margins, columns and gutters can all be controlled through the Margins and Columns dialogue box found through the Window menu.

### Moving pages and object layers

Use Window > Page panel to add new pages and change their order as well by dragging and dropping inside the panel.  You can also use the Pages panel to work with layers.  When you begin a brand new document it is likely that all of the objects you have already put into the document will appear on Layer 1.  You can add a new layer and then using the drop down lists of objects within each layer change their order within the layer itself and move each object to another layer.

### Wrapping objects with text

Now that you have inserted some text and graphics it is a good opportunity to try wrapping the text around the object.

You will need the Text Wrap panel from the Window menu to specify which sort of text wrap you are after.  With the image object selected choose the type of text wrap you are after whether it is 'none' or 'wrap around object shape'.  Notice that text in layers in front of the image will also wrap as well.

### Numbering pages

Insert a text frame where you want the page number to be.  Use Type > Insert > Special Character > Markers > Current Page Number.  This will automatically update if you move your page around.

### Working with Master Pages

Master pages are like templates for inDesign.  Any settings you apply to master pages are applied to the layout of a new page that you choose to use that layout.

Master pages are lettered from A onwards.  You may need to create a master page or a master spread depending on your requirements.

The principle for creating masters is as follows.  Design a page using frames and other objects which will be repeated across multiple pages.  Keep content which will be unique to a specific page out of the master.

Using the Pages panel drag the page from the pages area to the template area.  You should now have a new lettered master.  When you use Layout > Insert Page you can choose which master to use.
