##Lesson description

A Java class is like an idea within your application

You can have more than one class in a java file

A java virtual machine is like a simulation of the cpu and memory of a different computer

we simulate a JVM on a machine because you can get a JVM on many different platforms - this means the classes you write will run on many different platforms

we write text as .java - this is compiled into a binary class file through the JDK (or javac).  This binary .class file is then run in the JVM (also JRE) as a computer program
