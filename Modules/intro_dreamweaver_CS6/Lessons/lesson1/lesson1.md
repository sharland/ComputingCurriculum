Introduce you to the Dreamweaver workspace

## Lesson description

First thing to do is go to Preferences and change new document 'default document type' to HTML5.

### Brief introduction to workspace

1.  View mode buttons
  * Design mode: This shows a rough preview or WYSIWYG of the webpage.  It is not 'live though' as any javascript in the page is not being executed
  * Code mode: This shows the file you are working in in its raw code
  * Split mode: You can work side by side in code and design mode.  This is useful for seeing changes in your code take place straight away.
2. Page Title: You need a title!
3. Various tools such as validating page, visual aids, preview and responsive layout previews
4. Live Button: Shows the webpage in Dreamweaver as it would be looking when powered by Javascript
5. Live code button: splits the page into live view and code view (which you can't edit).  This is useful for seeing how any HTML is rewritten by javascript or Ajax in the site
6. Inspect button: This turns on CSS block styles in live mode as you move the cursor over them (Google chrome does something similar)
7. Status bar: contains important information about the page
8. Property Inspector: This changes what it shows depending on what you are working with in the page.  You will need to hit f5 or select refresh for this to do so.
9. Panels:  These contain a range of tools and features grouped together.  You can turn them on or off through the Window menu.
10. Use the Workspaces feature (button at top or found through Window menu) to access the 
different workspaces available.  I prefer 'designer compact' to get going with.
