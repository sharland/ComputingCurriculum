##Lesson description

- Look at what is the concept of Creative Coding
- look at generative art by showing some examples of Art works

Exercise: give pupils materials and either pre-written instructions or allow them to create their own instructions
- emphasise in the exercise how simple instructions can create complex results
- emphasise as well how new forms can be produced which weren't planned for or realised when writing the code
- leads to an interesting question: when we run this on a computer is the person who wrote the program the artist or is the computer?
- could this lead to computers creating their own art independently of other people?
- also another question to answer is which is the artwork, the code or the process completed by the computer?
