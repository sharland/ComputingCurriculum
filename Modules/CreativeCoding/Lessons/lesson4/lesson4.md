Theory to teach

*data types and variables*
- variables are used to store information
- variables have a type
- variable must be declared before it can be used
- syntax is
```java
type variablename = value;
```
- must have a semicolon
- basic variable types
|Type|Explanation|Example|
|--|--|
|boolean|has only two values such as true or false|boolean isOpen = true;|
|int|whole number, positive or negative including 0|int lucky = 7;|
|float|floating point number (32bit)|float balance = -213.456;|
|char|single character|char middleInitial = 'p';|
|string|string of characters(text)|string name = 'Brian'|
- can't change types once declared
- can't mix types
