##Lesson description

1. Show basics of a draw program including setup which is called once
```java
void setup() {
	...
}
```
2. Followed by draw which is called as a loop
```java
void draw() {
	...
}
```
3. Look at functions (code which gets things done)
  - built in functions such as `size(x,y)`, `background(grey)` or `random(n)`
  - call a function
    - type function name followed by brackets containing arguments
    - some functions don't require arguments and have nothing in brackets
  - define a function
  	- specify a return type
  	- specify name of the function
  	- keyword return used to send the value back
4. Look at types of errors
  - syntax errors: typing errors
  - semantic errors: the gap between what the programmer wants and what the program does
5. Look at comments
```java
/* A multi
line
comment
*/
```
```java
//a single line comment
int x = -1; //after a piece of code
```
