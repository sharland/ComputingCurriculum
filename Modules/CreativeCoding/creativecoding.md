#Creative Coding

Include a simple title.

##Target year group or age

This module is probably more suited for year 8 or 9 although pupils looking for an extension earlier may enjoy the module.

###Purpose of Module

This module is based on the [FutureLearn Creative Coding course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding/todo/388) and which I have tweaked to suit a more directed classroom format.

The purpose of this module is to look at how programming languages can be used to create artworks.

###Prior learning

A brief introduction to some key concepts of programming will probably help.  

###Knowledge and Skills

This module uses the [Processing programming language](http://www.processing.org) although it will hopefully be updated to include some further exercises for creative coding in Pascal. 

###Cross-Curricula links

This module has strong cross-curricula links with Art.

###Lessons

Add and link to lessons as appropriate

- Lesson 1

In this lesson pupils will look at what the terms Creative Coding and Generative Art means as well as some examples of how coding has been used to create everything from data visualisation to artwork to 3d sculptures.  Pupils will then begin by creating their own piece of generative art either on paper by using a set of instructions.
