# Introduction to Bootstrap

## Target year group or age

This module would be suitable for pupils from year 6 upwards although if a pupil has some experience of using HTML they could probably follow this.

### Purpose of Module

The purpose of this module is to take what pupils are learning about basic to intermediate HTML and CSS and apply it to a context by editing a Bootstrap template and theme.  Through this they can see how tags such as `<div>` are used in a realistic way.

### Prior Learning

I would recommend that pupils have either been through a module on the basics of HTML and CSS or used the [web track at Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) to complete at least up to 'HTML Basic 2'.

### Knowledge and Skills

In this module pupils are going to cover:
1. Choosing and using the right software
2. Downloading and setting up a Bootstrap template
3. Editing the HTML and content and inserting further tags and content

### Cross-Curricula links

This project could be used as a basis for building a portfolio of work for other subjects beyond Computing.

### Progression from this module

After completing this module pupils could progress onto further more advanced HTML modules or a Javascript or jquery module.

### Example work

This will be populated once pupil work starts to be posted online.

### DfE Computing Curriculum mapping

This module covers aspects of the following from KS3:
- Understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems
- Undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals, including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users
- Create, re-use, revise and re-purpose digital artefacts for a given audience, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability
- Understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely, including protecting their online identity and privacy; recognise inappropriate content, contact and conduct and know how to report concerns.

### CaS Progression Pathways mapping

This projects maps to the following strands on the CaS Progression pathways assessment framework:
- Information technology
- Communication and Networks

### Lessons

These lessons are planned for about one hour each.

- Lesson 1
In this lesson pupils will assess different sorts of development environments and then open their own school provided development environment.  Pupils will then use the software to build and test a very simple webpage using a basic HTML structure.
- Lesson 2
In this lesson pupils will download a Bootstrap template or use one provided by the school.  They will open it within their web-editing software and then begin by identifying the different parts of the web-page before beginning to edit simple text within the web-page itself. Pupils will also be encouraged to add further content through the use of simple hashtags such as `<p>` and `<h1>` and observe how the CSS styles the content.
- Lesson 3
In this lesson pupils will start to explore some more powerful tags such as `<div>` and `<section>` and start looking at how using different classes can control what tags can do.  Pupils will also start to identify `<div>` tags with a class name which can be used within CSS.
- Lesson 4
In this lesson pupils will look at how they can start to modify the CSS to control how the tags and associated content is displayed in the web browser. As part of this pupils will work with hexadecimal colours.
- Lesson 5
In this lesson you are going to do some work on the images within the site through `<img>` tags and CSS styles which control how an image works within a page.
- Lesson 6
In this lesson pupils will continue with some further CSS editing with background images as well as work with some colours.
- Lesson 7
In this lesson pupils will link the navigation toolbar to the different sections of the page and then complete any outstanding activities.
