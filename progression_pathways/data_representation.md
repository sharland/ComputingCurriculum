## Data & Data Representation

|#|Description|
|--|--|
|1.|Recognises that digital content can be represented in many forms. Distinguishes between some of these forms and can explain the different ways that they communicate information.|
|2.|Recognises different types of data: text, number. Appreciates that programs can work with different types of data. Recognises that data can be structured in tables to make it useful.|
|3.|Understands the difference between data and information. Knows why sorting data in a flat file can improve searching for information. Uses filters or can perform single criteria searches for information.|
|4.|Performs more complex searches for information e.g. using Boolean and relational operators. Analyses and evaluates data and information, and recognises that poor quality data leads to unreliable results, and inaccurate conclusions.|
|5.|Knows that digital computers use binary to represent all data. Understands how bit patterns represent numbers and images. Knows that computers transfer data in binary. Understands the relationship between binary and file size (uncompressed). Defines data types: real numbers and Boolean. Queries data on one table using a typical query language.|
|6.|Understands how numbers, images, sounds and character sets use the same bit patterns. Performs simple operations using bit patterns e.g. binary addition. Understands the relationship between resolution and colour depth, including the effect on file size. Distinguishes between data used in a simple program (a variable) and the storage structure for that data.|
|7.|Knows the relationship between data representation and data quality. Understands the relationship between binary and electrical circuits, including Boolean logic. Understands how and why values are data typed in many different languages when manipulated within programs.|
|8.|Performs operations using bit patterns e.g. conversion between binary and hexadecimal, binary subtraction etc. Understands and can explain the need for data compression, and performs simple compression methods. Knows what a relational database is, and understands the benefits of storing data in multiple tables.|
