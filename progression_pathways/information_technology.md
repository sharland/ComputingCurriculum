|1.|Uses software under the control of the teacher to create, store and edit digital content using appropriate file and folder names. Understands that people interact with computers. Shares their use of technology in school. Knows common uses of information technology beyond the classroom. Talks about their work and makes changes to improve it.|
|2.|Uses technology with increasing independence to purposefully organise digital content. Shows an awareness for the quality of digital content collected. Uses a variety of software to manipulate and present digital content: data and information. Shares their experiences of technology in school and beyond the classroom. Talks about their work and makes improvements to solutions based on feedback received.|
|3.|Collects, organises and presents data and information in digital content. Creates digital content to achieve a given goal through combining software packages and internet services to communicate with a wider audience e.g. blogging. Makes appropriate improvements to solutions based on feedback received, and can comment on the success of the solution.|
|4.|Makes judgements about digital content when evaluating and repurposing it for a given audience. Recognises the audience when designing and creating digital content. Understands the potential of information technology for collaboration when computers are networked. Uses criteria to evaluate the quality of solutions, can identify improvements making some refinements to the solution, and future solutions.|
|5.|Evaluates the appropriateness of digital devices, internet services and application software to achieve given goals. Recognises ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology beyond school. Designs criteria to critically evaluate the quality of solutions, uses the criteria to identify improvements and can make appropriate refinements to the solution.|
|6.|Justifies the choice of and independently combines and uses multiple digital devices, internet services and application software to achieve given goals. Evaluates the trustworthiness of digital content and considers the usability of visual design features when designing and creating digital artifacts for a known audience. Identifies and explains how the use of technology can impact on society. Designs criteria for users to evaluate the quality of solutions, uses the feedback from the users to identify improvements and can make appropriate refinements to the solution.|
|7.|Undertakes creative projects that collect, analyse, and evaluate data to meet the needs of a known user group. Effectively designs and creates digital artefacts for a wider or remote audience. Considers the properties of media when importing them into digital artefacts. Documents user feedback, the improvements identified and the refinements made to the solution. Explains and justifies how the use of technology impacts on society, from the perspective of social, economical, political, legal, ethical and moral issues.|
|8.|Understands the ethical issues surrounding the application of information technology, and the existence of legal frameworks governing its use e.g. Data Protection Act, Computer Misuse Act, Copyright etc.|
