# Progression Pathways
## Hardware & Processing

|#|Description|
|--|--|
|1.|Understands that computers have no intelligence and that computers can do nothing unless a program is executed. Recognises that all software executed on digital devices is programmed.|
|2.|Recognises that a range of digital devices can be considered a computer. Recognises and can use a range of input and output devices. Understands how programs specify the function of a general purpose computer.|
|3.|Knows that computers collect data from various input devices, including sensors and application software. Understands the difference between hardware and application software, and their roles within a computer system.|
|4.|Understands why and when computers are used. Understands the main functions of the operating system. Knows the difference between physical, wireless and mobile networks.|
|5.|Recognises and understands the function of the main internal parts of basic computer architecture. Understands the concepts behind the fetch-execute cycle. Knows that there is a range of operating systems and application software for the same hardware.|
|6.|Understands the von Neumann architecture in relation to the fetch-execute cycle, including how data is stored in memory. Understands the basic function and operation of location addressable memory.|
|7.|Knows that processors have instruction sets and that these relate to low-level instructions carried out by a computer.|
|8.|Has practical experience of a small (hypothetical) low level programming language. Understands and can explain Mooreâ€™s Law. Understands and can explain multitasking by computers.|
