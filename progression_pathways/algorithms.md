## Algorithms

|#|Description|
|--|--|
|1.|Understands what an algorithm is and is able to express simple linear (non-branching) algorithms symbolically. Understands that computers need precise instructions. Demonstrates care and precision to avoid errors.|
|2.|Understands that algorithms are implemented on digital devices as programs. Designs simple algorithms using loops, and selection i.e. if statements. Uses logical reasoning to predict outcomes. Detects and corrects errors i.e. debugging, in algorithms.|
|3.|Designs solutions (algorithms) that use repetition and two-way selection i.e. if, then and else. Uses diagrams to express solutions. Uses logical reasoning to predict outputs, showing an awareness of inputs.|
|4.|Shows an awareness of tasks best completed by humans or computers. Designs solutions by decomposing a problem and creates a sub-solution for each of these parts (decomposition). Recognises that different solutions exist for the same problem.|
|5.|Understands that iteration is the repetition of a process such as a loop. Recognises that different algorithms exist for the same problem. Represents solutions using a structured notation. Can identify similarities and differences in situations and can use these to solve problems (pattern recognition).|
|6.|Understands a recursive solution to a problem repeatedly applies the same solution to smaller instances of the problem. Recognises that some problems share the same characteristics and use the same algorithm to solve both (generalisation). Understands the notion of performance for algorithms and appreciates that some algorithms have different performance characteristics for the same task.|
|7.|Recognises that the design of an algorithm is distinct from its expression in a programming language (which will depend on the programming constructs available). Evaluates the effectiveness of algorithms and models for similar problems. Recognises where information can be filtered out in generalizing problem solutions (abstraction). Uses logical reasoning to explain how an algorithm works. Represents algorithms using structured language.|
|8.|Designs a solution to a problem that depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem (recursion). Understands that some problems cannot be solved computationally.|
