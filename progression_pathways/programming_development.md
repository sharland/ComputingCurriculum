# Progression Pathways
## Programming & development

|#|Description|
|--|--|
|1.|Knows that users can develop their own programs, and can demonstrate this by creating a simple program in an environment that does not rely on text e.g. programmable robots etc. Executes, checks and changes programs. Understands that programs execute by following precise instructions.|
|2.|Uses arithmetic operators, if statements, and loops, within programs. Uses logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of programs. Detects and corrects simple semantic errors i.e. debugging, in programs.|
|3.|Creates programs that implement algorithms to achieve given goals. Declares and assigns variables. Uses post-tested loop e.g. ‘until’, and a sequence of selection statements in programs, including an if, then and else statement.|
|4.|Understands the difference between, and appropriately uses if and if, then and else statements. Uses a variable and relational operators within a loop to govern termination. Designs, writes and debugs modular programs using procedures. Knows that a procedure can be used to hide the detail with sub-solution (procedural abstraction).|
|5.|Understands that programming bridges the gap between algorithmic solutions and computers. Has practical experience of a high-level textual language, including using standard libraries when programming. Uses a range of operators and expressions e.g. Boolean, and applies them in the context of program control. Selects the appropriate data types.|
|6.|Uses nested selection statements. Appreciates the need for, and writes, custom functions including use of parameters. Knows the difference between, and uses appropriately, procedures and functions. Understands and uses negation with operators. Uses and manipulates one dimensional data structures. Detects and corrects syntactical errors.|
|7.|Appreciates the effect of the scope of a variable e.g. a local variable can’t be accessed from outside its function. Understands and applies parameter passing. Understands the difference between, and uses, both pre-tested e.g. ‘while’, and post-tested e.g. ‘until’ loops. Applies a modular approach to error detection and correction.|
|8.|Designs and writes nested modular programs that enforce reusability utilising sub-routines whereever possible. Understands the difference between ‘While’ loop and ‘For’ loop, which uses a loop counter. Understands and uses two dimensional data structures.|
